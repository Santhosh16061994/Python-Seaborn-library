# Python-Seaborn-library


### What is seaborn in Python for?
Python Seaborn library is a widely popular data visualization library that is commonly used for data science and machine learning tasks.
You build it on top of the matplotlib data visualization library and can perform exploratory analysis. You can create interactive plots to answer questions about your data.

### What are seaborn and matplotlib used for?
Matplotlib is a library in Python that enables users to generate visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts and much more. 
Seaborn is a visualization library that is built on top of Matplotlib. It provides data visualizations that are typically more aesthetic and statistically sophisticated.

### Should I use seaborn vs matplotlib?
Seaborn is more comfortable with Pandas data frames. It utilizes simple sets of techniques to produce lovely images in Python.
Matplotlib is highly customized and robust. With the help of its default themes, Seaborn prevents overlapping plots.

### Why seaborn is better than matplotlib?
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on. 
Seaborn: Seaborn, on the other hand, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes.
